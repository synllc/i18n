# Hollywood internationalization
This is the submodule for storing the [hollywood](https://github.com/synllc/hollywood) internationalization files. Changes applied to this repository will eventually be merged upstream with the hollywood repository, sometimes selectively depending on ongoing translation work and necessity.

## Contribution
We welcome all pull requests and other contributions to our internalization/translation efforts. However, the work of our internal team will be prioritized over community contributions until all prerequisite languages are fully implemented. Bear in mind that the stringset changes very regularly since hollywood is in the midst of a heavy development cycle, therefore there will regularly be something new to translate and translations will rarely stay complete for the time being.
